   <h1>Who is Skip?</h1>
   <a href="index.html">Recipe Page</a>
    <p>Skip comes from a family that has been in the food industry, cooking for nearly 40 years. He loves to experiment with different herbs, spices, fruits and vegtables to enhance flavor. It all started when I was 10 yrs old and did the unthinkable, I added cinnamon to a burger! Needless to say, that was a failed experiment. As I grew up, I learned more about the amazing world of spices and everything else came together. </p>
