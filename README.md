# Recipes
I will be working on a recipe webpage that uses all the html knowledge I have learned thus far. I will take my time & make sure that this basic webpage is as clean and concise as I can make it. My goal is to become comfortable moving around vs code and using git to commit my changes and updates. 
Learned the process for pulling images from websites and local folders on my mac. 
Page is organized and pictures are displaying well, resize photos well wiith no issues. 
Heading, title, list coming through perfectly. Will be glad to learn moving text to left, center, and right orientation to further organize text.
