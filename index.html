   <h2><div class=header-2>Ingredients</div></h2> 
   <ul>
    <li>One 15.5-ounce (440-gram) can cannellini beans, drained, rinsed and <strong><em>patted very dry</em></strong></li>
    <li>1/2 cup (70 grams) chopped drained jarred roasted red peppers, <strong><em>patted very dry</em></strong></li>
    <li>2 tablespoons (60 grams) white miso</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sambal</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, crushed and peeled</li>
    <li>Zest and juice of 1 lime</li>
    <li>1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
    <li>Kosher salt, if needed</li>
    <li>Flaky salt, for serving</li>
    <li>Red, purple or pink dippers, such as red bell or baby bell peppers, grape tomatoes, steamed red or purple potato wedges, red endive leaves, red trevisano radicchio leaves, purple bell pepper strips, beet chips or radishes, for serving</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Cooking Directions</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, add the beans, peppers, miso, sambal, ginger, honey, garlic and lime zest and juice. Process, scraping down the sides of the bowl once or twice in between, until very smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. With the processor running, add the olive oil in a steady stream until incorporated and the dip is smooth, light and creamy. Taste and season with kosher salt if needed. (The dip can be served right away or made ahead and chilledâ€”your choice.)</li>
    <li>Transfer the dip to a serving bowl and garnish with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of flaky salt. Serve with dippers of your choice.</li>
    <li>The dip can be made ahead and refrigerated. It will keep for 3 or 4 days in the refrigerator and will thicken a bit as it chills.</li>
   </ol>

   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
    <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>2 pounds ground chicken</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more for seasoning</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fennel seeds</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons flour</li>
    <li>2 (15-ounce cans) cannellini or other white beans, rinsed and drained</li>
    <li>1 bunch (about 1 pound) Swiss chard, stems removed, leaves chopped into 1-inch pieces</li>
    <li>11/2 cups frozen corn, thawed</li>
    <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken stock</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper for seasoning</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Cooking Directions</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the ground chicken, 1 teaspoon salt, cumin, fennel seeds, oregano, and chili powder. Cook, stirring frequently, until the chicken is cooked through, about 8 minutes. Stir the flour into the chicken mixture. Add the beans, Swiss chard, corn, and chicken stock. Bring the mixture to a simmer, scraping up the brown bits that cling to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Simmer for 55-60 minutes until the liquid has reduced by about half and the chili has thickened. Add the red pepper flakes and simmer for another 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
    <li>Ladle the chili into serving bowls. Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley.</li>
   </ol>
