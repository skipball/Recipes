   <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
   <ul>
    <li>One 15.5-ounce (440-gram) can cannellini beans, drained, rinsed and <strong><em>patted very dry</em></strong></li>
    <li>1/2 cup (70 grams) chopped drained jarred roasted red peppers, <strong><em>patted very dry</em></strong></li>
    <li>2 tablespoons (60 grams) white miso</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sambal</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, crushed and peeled</li>
    <li>Zest and juice of 1 lime</li>
    <li>1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
    <li>Kosher salt, if needed</li>
    <li>Flaky salt, for serving</li>
    <li>Red, purple or pink dippers, such as red bell or baby bell peppers, grape tomatoes, steamed red or purple potato wedges, red endive leaves, red trevisano radicchio leaves, purple bell pepper strips, beet chips or radishes, for serving</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Cooking Directions</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, add the beans, peppers, miso, sambal, ginger, honey, garlic and lime zest and juice. Process, scraping down the sides of the bowl once or twice in between, until very smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. With the processor running, add the olive oil in a steady stream until incorporated and the dip is smooth, light and creamy. Taste and season with kosher salt if needed. (The dip can be served right away or made ahead and chilledâ€”your choice.)</li>
    <li>Transfer the dip to a serving bowl and garnish with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of flaky salt. Serve with dippers of your choice.</li>
    <li>The dip can be made ahead and refrigerated. It will keep for 3 or 4 days in the refrigerator and will thicken a bit as it chills.</li>
   </ol>
